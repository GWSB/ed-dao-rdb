-- This evolution:
-- - Replaces FlagCopyVio and Illegal with FlagInapt
-- - Adds hidden/deleted-at/-by columns, and Undelete actions
-- - Adds ClearFlag action
-- - Updates DW1_POSTS indexes to take into account that posts can be hidden and deleted
-- - Changes Reject ('Rjct') to Delete-Post ('DelPost')
-- - Adds DW1_POSTS.LAST_MANUALLY_APPROVED_BY_ID
