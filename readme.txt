Download the Oracle JDBC driver from here:
  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/jdbc-112010-090769.html

Version 11.2.0.2.0, this file: "ojdbc6.jar (2,152,051 bytes) - Classes
for use with JDK 1.6. It contains the JDBC driver classes except
classes for NLS support in Oracle Object and Collection types."

(If the above link is broken, search the Web for "Oracle Database 11g
Release 2 JDBC Drivers".)

I think I'm not allowed to add the driver to the Git repo, because of
licensing issues â€” you need to accept a certain license before
downloading and using the driver.
