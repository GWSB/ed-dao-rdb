I'll probably *NOT* do as described below.
--------
create table DW1_TENANT_OWNERS(
  OWNED_TENANT_ID varchar(32) not null,
  OWNER_LOGIN_TENANT_ID varchar(32) not null,
  OWNER_LOGIN_ROLE_ID varchar(32) not null,
  CTIME timestamp default now() not null,
);

-- Perhaps in the future, make it possible with superadmins for a restricted
-- group of websites:
--   A superadmin with LOGIN_TENANT_ID = X can manage all tenants owned by
--   owners with DW1_TENANT_OWNERS.LOGIN_TENANT_ID = X, but no
--   other tenants. So, for example, if you are a www.example.com superadmin,
--   you may manage all tenants created from www.ex.com. But not
--   tenants created from ex2.com (unless ex2.com was created via www.ex.com
--   "recursively").
-- But for now: Everything will be created via www.debiki.com, so superadmins
-- will have access to exactly everything.
